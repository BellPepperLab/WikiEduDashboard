            Welcome to your Wikipedia project timeline. This page will guide you
            through the Wikipedia project for your course. Be sure to check with
            your instructor to see if there are other pages you should be
            following as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page breaks down writing a Wikipedia article into a series of
            steps, or milestones. These steps include online trainings to help
            you get started on Wikipedia. Please complete all assigned trainings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your course has also been assigned a Wikipedia Content Expert. Check
            your Talk page for notes from them. You can also reach them through
            the "<strong>Get Help</strong>" button on this page.

          <p>
            In this assignment, you'll evaluate a Wikipedia article related to
            the course. The goal of this assignment is to get you thinking about
            what a "good" Wikipedia article might look like and to learn how to
            evaluate an article on Wikipedia for quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you're ready, search for an article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>
            using the "Search Wikipedia" toolbar on the Wikipedia home page. The
            topic you choose should be related to your course or something you're
            personally interested in. Then, read through it. After you've read
            through the article once, create a section in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/sandbox">your Sandbox</a>
            titled "Article evaluation" where you'll leave notes about your
            observations and learnings.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you have your section ready, review the article again. As you
            read, consider the following questions and include your notes in
            your Sandbox (but don't feel limited to these):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How does the way Wikipedia discusses this topic differ from the way we've talked about it in class?</li>
            <li>Is everything in the article relevant to the article topic? Is there anything that distracted you?</li>
            <li>Is the article neutral? Are there any claims that appear heavily biased toward a particular position?</li>
            <li>Are there viewpoints that are overrepresented, or underrepresented?</li>
            <li>
              Go to the References section and check a few citations. Do the
              links work? How many of the sources provided are from the last
              year? The last five years?
            </li>
            <li>
              Is each fact referenced with an appropriate, reliable reference?
              Where does the information come from? Are these neutral sources?
              If biased, is that bias noted?
            </li>
            <li>
               Check out the Talk page of the article. What kinds of conversations,
               if any, are going on behind the scenes about how to represent this topic?
            </li>
            <li>
              Also, on the Talk page, check to see how the article is rated
              (if it's rated at all). Is it a part of any WikiProjects?
            </li>

            Now that you're thinking about what makes a "good" Wikipedia article,

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wikipedians often talk about "content gaps." What do you think a content gap is, and what are some possible ways to identify them?</li>
            <li>What are some reasons a content gap might arise? What are some ways to remedy them?</li>
            <li>Does it matter who writes Wikipedia?</li>
            <li>What does it mean to be "unbiased" on Wikipedia? How is that different, or similar, to your own definition of "bias"?</li>

            In this assignment, you'll make a <em>live</em> edit on Wikipedia. This
            means you're being asked to add new content to an article. This new
            content should include one or two new sentences, backed up with a
            related citation.
          </p>
          <p>When you're ready, choose one of these two options:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Option 1:</strong> Search or browse for an article on Wikipedia.
              The topic you select should be related to your course or something
              you're personally interested in and read through it. Find one small
              thing that you think is missing, then search for a source online
              that can help you fill that need. When you're ready, <em>Edit</em>
              the page and draft up your contribution. Then, use the <em>Cite</em>
              tool to add your citation. When you're done, save your changes!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Option 2:</strong> The <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/citationhunt/en">Citation Hunt</a>
              shows unreferenced statements from articles. First, evaluate whether
              the statement in question is true! An uncited statement could just
              be lacking a reference or it could be inaccurate or misleading.
              Next, find a citation to help you complete the request. Reliable
              sources on the subject will help you choose whether to add it or
              correct the statement. Once you've found what you want to change,
              <em>Edit</em> the page and draft up your contribution. Then, use
              the <em>Cite</em> tool to add your citation. When you're done,
              save your changes!

              For adding citations and new text, we recommend using <em>Visual editing</em>.
              You can switch from (or to) <em>Source editing</em> by clicking the pencil icon,
              once you've entered edit mode.

            <li>
              Don't forget to leave an edit summary of what you contributed! Did
              you add a new reference or external link to the article? Awesome!
              Let the other Wikipedian's working on the article know. Whenever
              you make an edit on Wikipedia you should always save an edit summary.

            that you want to improve. Then try to find at least 2 reliable sources
            that are related to your article and read each reference. (The sources
            you find should not already be linked from your Wikipedia article.)
            Based on what you learned in your readings of the article and the one

            In this assignment, you will finalize your topic and start building
            your bibliography for your article.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you begin, check the "My Articles" block on the <strong>Home</strong>
            tab of this course page. Do you have your topic assigned to yourself?
            If not, please add it using the "Assign myself an article" button. (You can
            assign additional articles or remove one by clicking the "+/-" button.)
          <p>
            Now, create a section in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/sandbox">your Sandbox</a>
            titled "Bibliography" and begin formatting and linking to the sources you've found.
          </p>
          <h4>Tips</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Review the "Sources and Citations" training to help you determine
              the best sources to use to expand your article draft.
            </li>
            <li>You can ask your Content Expert questions anytime using the "Get Help" button on your course page. </li>
            <li>
              Make sure you're using more than just a Google search to find your
              sources, as not all Google hits are considered to be reliable
              sources and not all sources are indexed by Google.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be sure to check which types of sources are acceptable for the field
              you're contributing to. This may differ from traditionally acceptable
              academic sources in your field.

          <p>In this assignment, you will start working on your draft.</p>
          <h4>If you're updating an existing article</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Review the Wikipedia article you plan to update and outline the
              content that is already there. What sections are included? Determine
              the one or two areas that need your improvement, and maybe pick out
              one section that does not yet exist that you can add.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, outline your plans for improving the article. At a minimum,
              your contributions should include a complete new paragraph related
              to the topic and supported by a citation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure that your content is not just a re-telling of what's already
              available. Read over the existing article carefully, as well as related
              articles that may cover the same topics. What new information can
              you contribute to make the article more comprehensive?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>If you're creating a new article</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Look at a Wikipedia article about a similar topic. Are you working
              on a biography? On an article about a policy issue? Review the
              article and take notes about what sections are included.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, using what you learned as a starting point, outline the article
              you plan to create. At a minimum, a new article should include a
              lead section and one additional paragraph, with at least three
              citations. If you plan to write more than two paragraphs, consider
              breaking down the article into multiple sections.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will need to show there are enough sources to write about the
              topic. You must reference at least three independent, reliable
              sources such as academic papers or news articles that discuss the
              topic you have chosen in depth.

          <p>
            In this assignment, you'll work on expanding your content into a
            complete first draft. You should still be working in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/sandbox">your Sandbox</a>
            this week.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you haven't started transforming your outline into complete full
            paragraphs yet, start now. Remember, Wikipedia articles are built up
            over time through small changes. Your first contributions should include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A factual assertion, related to the topic and referenced to a
              reliable source. If you're creating a new article you should have
              two to four sources at a minimum.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some context for a general reader to interpret that assertion,
              without pushing a particular viewpoint or avoiding something
              obvious and necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
               Write the content in direct language, accessible to the general
               public. Don't assume that the reader is familiar with overly
               technical language.
            </li>
            <li>
               Don't write too much at once! Adding a very large or dramatic
               change to a page makes it harder for other editors to review it
               and if some of the material you've added is unacceptable then
               your addition might be reverted even though other parts are good.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By the end of this assignment your draft should be ready for peer
            review. If you'd like your Content Expert to review your draft
            before then, use the "Get Help" button in your Sandbox to request
            review. They might not get back to you immediately, so please leave
            appropriate time for feedback.
          </p>
          <h4>Tips</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Two to four sources are the barest minimum. Some topics require
              more sourcing to establish notability and verify information.
            </li>
            <li>
               You should not move your article or add your contribution to the
               mainspace yet.
            </li>

            Once you've made improvements to your article based on peer review

          <p>
            To complete this assignment, you're being asked to either move a new

              edited or updated since you last looked? If changes have been made
              that impact your contribution, re-work your draft to fit the article
              as it stands. Remember, Wikipedia is constantly growing and changing!
            </li>
            <li>
              Once you have your draft finalized, begin copying your text into
              the "live" article. Moving the content section by section can
              help reduce chances of mistakes or errors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be sure to copy text from your sandbox while the sandbox page is
              in 'Edit' mode. This ensures that the formatting is transferred
              correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
              When editing a pre-existing article, do not cut and paste your
              whole draft over the entire article in one edit. If another editor
              removes your additions, do not immediately re-add the content -
              discuss the action with the editor and/or your content expert.
              Always try to assume good faith!

          <ul>
            <li>
              Do a quick search and make sure someone hasn't created your article
              while you've been drafting your work. Remember to check for topic
              name variations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Review the <a href="../../../training/students/sandboxes">Sandboxes and Mainspace</a>

          <h4>Tips</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Once your work is live make sure that your "Sandbox" template
              isn't in your draft. If so, "Edit" the article and delete the
              "Sandbox" template, then save changes again.

          <p>
            In this assignment, you will continue to work on your contribution
            in the article mainspace and respond to any community feedback. At
            this point, you should be working "live" on Wikipedia!\
          </p>
          <p>
            To start, please read <a href="https://wikiedu.org/editingwikipedia">Editing Wikipedia</a>
            page 12 to see how to create links from your article to others, and
            from other articles to your own. Try to link to 3–5 articles from
            your article, and to link to your article from 2–3 other, related
            articles. You should also try to add any relevant categories to your
            article.
          </p>

            <li>
              Have you been thinking about adding images or illustrations to your
              article? If so, please review the <a href="../../../training/students/images-and-media">"Contributing Images and Media" training</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Tips</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Respond to any feedback you receive on your contribution. If you're
              unsure of how to proceed, reach out to your content expert.
            </li>
            <li>
               Always assume good faith from other editors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Editing in the mainspace means that others can greatly edit or
              remove your work. If this happens, don't be upset - just contact
              the editor(s) via their talk page or the article's talk page to
              ask why they made the changes.

            The best articles on Wikipedia include photographs, illustrations,
            diagrams, or other media. This assignment, you're being asked to
            evaluate whether your article has the appropriate images or graphs
            to illustrate its content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you start, review the <a href="https://wikiedu.org/illustratingwikipedia">Illustrating Wikipedia</a>
            handbook. It will help you understand copyright laws, including what kinds of images are allowed on Wikipedia.
          </p>
          <p>
            To find an image that already exists check out <strong>commons.wikimedia.org</strong>
            or <strong>search.creativecommons.org</strong>. Enter your search query
            and decide, do any of the images that appear apply to my article? If so,
            upload them (if they aren't on Wikimedia Commons already) and add them
            to article.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The vast majority of images you see on the Internet are not eligible
              to be used on Wikipedia. Unless you're uploading an image you created
              yourself, the rules for what can and cannot be uploaded are tricky.
              Be sure you understand what qualifies by consulting the <em>Illustrating Wikipedia</em>
              handbook. Just because a site says an image is "free" doesn't mean
              it can be uploaded. Never upload an image you find online without
              carefully checking its license against the allowed licenses for
              Wikimedia Commons. If it's unclear, it's better to find something
              else to upload.
